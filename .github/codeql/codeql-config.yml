# CodeQL configuration: keep a focused set of queries to avoid noisy / low-value findings
# See: https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/manual/using-queries/
queries:
  # Run the standard security + quality query suite for C/C++ (balanced coverage)
  - security-and-quality

# Optionally you can add or remove specific queries here. Keep this file minimal to reduce noisy results.
