# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing! Your contributions keep this project healthy, maintainable, and useful.

## Why Contribute?
Following these guidelines ensures that contributions are clear, complete, and respectful of the time of maintainers and other contributors. All types of contributions are welcome:
- Code fixes and improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- Bug reports and feature requests

### What We Do Not Accept
Clearly define what is out-of-scope to prevent wasted effort:
- Issues unrelated to the project’s goals
- Support questions (use Stack Overflow or community channels)
- Large features without prior discussion

---

## Ground Rules
- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility where relevant.
- Follow code style and testing standards.

**Small fixes** (typos, formatting, minor bugs) can often be submitted directly via a PR without extensive discussion.

    - `feat:` for new features
    - `fix:` for bug fixes
    - `docs:` for documentation changes
    - `chore:` for tasks like build/config updates
- Keep messages concise but descriptive (50 chars for subject, detailed body if needed).

### Branch Naming
- Feature branches: `feature/<short-description>`
- Fix branches: `fix/<short-description>`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<short-description>`

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Link related issues in the PR description.
- Include screenshots or logs if relevant.
- Ensure all tests pass and linting checks are successful.

Use labels consistently to indicate the type and status of issues and pull requests.
- `bug`: For issues reporting a defect or unexpected behavior.
- `feature`: For requests or PRs introducing new functionality.
- `documentation`: For changes or issues related to documentation.
- Add other relevant labels as needed (e.g., `help wanted`, `good first issue`, `enhancement`, `question`).
- When opening an issue or PR, select the most appropriate labels to help maintainers triage and prioritize.
- If unsure which label to use, leave a comment and maintainers will assist.
